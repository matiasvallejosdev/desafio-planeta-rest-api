Climate challenge is an application to storing, finding and getting data about the [desafioplaneta.com]() game. The application was developed to be consumed inside game.

ClimateChallengeAPI performs and authentication system internally to deny the external callings without authorization rules. The rules will be stored in the video game and grant permissions on singles Resources or whole Categories.

A comprehensive [REST API](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/geostore/wiki/REST-API) allows an easy handling of game data inside a database and s3 instance to save static files like images, sprites and audio. So, that client applications can easily query the data game in order to retrieve information dynamically, a utility django class hides the REST complexities.
